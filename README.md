This is the decompiled source from `/system/priv-app/InProcessNetworkStack/InProcessNetworkStack.jar` in Samsung Galaxy Note-10+ Phone (Hong Kong version), as at October 2020.

The background of decompiling this source code is that it contains evidence
that the code, without knowledge and consent of its owner, make DNS queries
of and connects to Chinese websites qq.com, baidu.com, taobao.com and hao123.com
in some situations when it assumes that it is operating in Hong Kong,
Macau and Mainland China.

The code are adapted by Samsung from Android source which are open sourced
under Apache License. For the modifications made by Samsung,
I claim fair use for posting its work, for the purpose of 
criticism, comment, news reporting, and research concerning the Samsung
phones.
